## <span style="color:Yellow"> Important Considerations: </span>
* Ensure you are using the Contoso - MCAPS Managed environment (some features may not function in the MSFT Non-prod environment).
* Prefer using the East US, East US2, and Sweden Central regions (where all services/models are available)
* Ensure you have sufficient quota available (in case you need to use regional deployments).
* Private networks - <span style="color:Red">out of scope</span>
